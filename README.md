# Energy Consumption Forecasting

This project aims to predict energy consumption based on historical data using various machine learning models, including ARIMA, Random Forest, and LSTM.
## Project Description

The dataset used for this project contains **hourly energy consumption** data from a transmission system operator. The goal is to predict future electricity demand using machine learning models, which could be helpful in optimizing energy generation, distribution, and management.

The project includes:
- **Data preprocessing**: Cleaning, feature extraction, and handling missing values.
- **Modeling**: ARIMA (statistical model), Random Forest (machine learning), and LSTM (deep learning).
- **Evaluation**: Performance comparison based on MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset files.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model training.
- **src/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.
